Protocol Name : Webmaster 

Protocol Specification : 

    This protocol is designed for effective transfer of files and their viewing over the network . There is a special markup language defined for the same called the Markem language . The language is defined in the corresponding Markem.txt file. The protocol is simple :
        
        -> The client sends the file to be accessed to the server using a TCP/IP protocol . Once the server receivers the request , it forks a child and sends the appropriate file to be displayed using the Markem markup language . Immediately after the transfer , the server shuts down the connection . This saves it from keeping too many connections at any point of time .

Things Done :

1 Created a repository for the easy maintainance of the code.


Things to be Done:

1 Create proper server-client model for the transfer of files.
2 Increase the Markem language for easy representation .

Features that can be implemented :

1 Images transfer
2 Adding some form of styling to the page.
3 IF possible , introduce the concept of https connection.
